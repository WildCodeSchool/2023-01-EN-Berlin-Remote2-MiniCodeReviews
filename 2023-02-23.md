**Mini task:** _Write an arrow function (or a non-arrow function) that checks if a string starts with the letter "o"._

### Examples of use

Assuming that the function is called "foo", then executing `foo("oklahoma")` and `foo("bermuda")` should in the first case indicate that `"oklahoma"` starts with a letter "o" whereas in the second case `"bermuda"` does not.

This can be theoretically indicated by returning something from the function, or displaying something on the screen using the runtime such as "yes it starts with an o" or "no it does not start with an o".

### Feedback

Please write your feedback in bullet points under each solution, be concise/kind, offer a reasonable babystep, or reason around the code in a way that helps the person who posted the solution understand the logic/reasoning underlying the task.

Do not remove feedback written by others, just add more bullet points under each solution. Names of coders and reviewers do not matter, we are all here to learn how to code and peer-review (teaching others) is a very important part of learning.

### Right of editing

If you do not want your code reviewed, then you can simply delete the section which corresponds to your code. But please do not delete code or reviews contributed by others.
